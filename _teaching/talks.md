The following is a collection of lecture notes or slides from various talks I have given, on both my own research and other topics:
- **Zero-curvature formulation for novel 2d field theories**: Talk at the Cornell algebraic geometry seminar on my [integrable harmonic map equations project](/projects/harmonic_maps_project/). ([pdf](/assets/pdf/talks/Cornell_3-May-2021.pdf))
- **Fourier Transforms and Physical Dualities**: Talk at the UIC geometry, topoloy and dynamics seminar on my [self-dual geometric Langlands project](/projects/self_dual_langlands_project/). Heavily annotated with presentation-specific notes. ([pdf](/assets/pdf/talks/UIC_17-Feb-2020.pdf))
- **The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface**: Series of two lectures given at PCMI on Hitchin's paper of the same name, in preparation for [Laura Schaposnik's](https://schapos.people.uic.edu) advanced course on Higgs bundles. ([pdf](/assets/pdf/talks/PCMI-Lectures-SDeqns.pdf))
- **Introduction to Mirror Symmetry**: Talk given at the 2016 *Superschool on Derived Categories and D-branes*. ([pdf](/assets/pdf/talks/IntroMSTalk_Edmonton.pdf))
- **The Grothendieck Spectral Sequence**: Talk given for the 2017 UT Austin minicourse on spectral sequences. ([pdf](/assets/pdf/talks/GSS_talk_12-May-2017.pdf))
