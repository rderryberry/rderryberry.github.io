I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics; until August of 2021 I was a Coxeter Postdoctoral Fellow, a joint position with the Perimeter Institute and the University of Toronto. I completed my PhD in 2018 at the University of Texas at Austin, jointly supervised by [David Ben-Zvi](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/benzvi/) and [Andy Neitzke](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~an592/).

My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/CV-current.pdf).

My research takes place at the intersection of mathematics and physics, and is based on the following philosophy:

> *Physical theories predict mathematical structures, and*
>
> *physical dualities predict mathematical equivalences.*

Check out some of my [projects](/projects/) to see what this philosophy looks like in action.
